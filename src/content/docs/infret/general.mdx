The book "Introduction to Information Retrieval" by C.D. Manning, P. Raghavan and H. Sch√ºtze can be found [here](/infret_files/irbookonlinereading.pdf). Personally I found it quite useful if you want a different view / explanation on the topics discussed in the lectures, but it is not required for passing the course.

There is a cool [visualisation tool](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BPlusTree.html) for B+-Trees to help understand how they work. Pretty useful if you are struggling with understanding the definition. Just beware that they might use a different definition as we do.

## Exercises

There are weekly quizzes and Jupyter Notebooks that you may solve as an exercise. I would recommend to do the weekly quizzes at least, since they will give you the most benefit for the exam.

## Bonus points

There is an opportunity to receive bonus points, up to 0.25, which will count towards your final grade. The bonus consists of three of the weekly quizzes, from which you will need to get the required points from two of them, on the dates specified below:

- 21.03 Tolerant Retrieval
- 18.04 Index Compression
- 02.05 Vector Space Model

It is possible to pass the quizzes without solving the Jupyter-Notebook, but I would recommend to solve it in the week with the bonuses. The time limit for each quiz is one week, you have two attempts.
